# memOS.as Development Progress Log

This document tracks the development progress and current state of the memOS.as microservice.

## Milestone 1: Core Infrastructure and API (Completed)

*   [x] **Tiered Storage Endpoints:** The API endpoints for storing and retrieving memories from the different tiers (Redis, PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Neo4j) have been implemented.
*   [x] **Tool Management Endpoints:** The API endpoints for registering, retrieving, and searching for tools have been implemented.
*   [x] **Observability:** The service has been instrumented with basic observability using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Jaeger.
*   [x] **Dockerization:** The service has been containerized using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Current State of Affairs (2025-08-17)

The `memOS.as` service is partially functional. The core API endpoints have been implemented, and the service can be started using `docker compose up`. However, there are significant issues with the test environment that are preventing the verification of the service's functionality.

### Key Achievements:
*   **Tiered Storage Endpoints:** The API endpoints for storing and retrieving memories from the different tiers (Redis, PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Neo4j) have been implemented.
*   **Tool Management Endpoints:** The API endpoints for registering, retrieving, and searching for tools have been implemented.
*   **Observability:** The service has been instrumented with basic observability using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Jaeger.
*   **Dockerization:** The service has been containerized using Docker and Docker Compose.
*   **End-to-End Integration:** The service can be successfully called from an external service (`InGest-LLM.as`) and can store memories.

### Current Challenges:
*   **Test Environment:** The tests are consistently failing with `httpx.ConnectError: [Errno 111] Connection refused` and `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError` when run from the `test-runner` container. This indicates a networking issue between the `test-runner` container and the other services.
*   **Host-based Testing:** Running the tests on the host machine is also failing with `ModuleNotFoundError` and `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError`, which indicates issues with resolving the service hostnames and the Python path.
*   **Neo4j Constraint Issue:** An issue with a Neo4j constraint violation was identified during end-to-end testing with `InGest-LLM.as`. A fix has been implemented, but it has not been possible to verify it due to the testing issues.

### Next Steps:
The immediate priority is to resolve the testing issues to be able to verify the functionality of the service. The following steps will be taken:
1.  **Stabilize the Test Environment:** A systematic approach will be taken to debug the `test-runner` service and resolve the networking and import issues.
2.  **Verify the Neo4j Fix:** Once the test environment is stable, the fix for the Neo4j constraint issue will be tested.
3.  **Full Integration Testing:** Once all the tests are passing, a full end-to-end integration test with `InGest-LLM.as` will be performed to verify the complete functionality of the `memOS.as` service.

## 2025-08-17: Integration Testing and Test Environment Debugging

*   **End-to-End Integration:** Successfully tested the end-to-end integration of `memOS.as` with `InGest-LLM.as`. The `memOS.as` service is able to receive requests from `InGest-LLM.as` and store memories.
*   **Neo4j Constraint Issue:** Identified and implemented a fix for the Neo4j constraint violation issue.
*   **Test Environment:** Spent a significant amount of time debugging the test environment. The tests are still failing with `httpx.ConnectError` and `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError` when run from the `test-runner` container.
*   **Next Steps:** The immediate priority is to stabilize the test environment to be able to verify the functionality of the service.
