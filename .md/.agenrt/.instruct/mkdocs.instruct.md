# Integrating MkDocs for Project Documentation

This guide provides a step-by-step plan for integrating a professional, searchable documentation site into the devenviro.as ecosystem using MkDocs and the Material for MkDocs theme.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, we need to add MkDocs and its popular "Material" theme to our project's Python dependencies.

1.  **Open requirements.txt**.
2.  Add the following lines to the end of the file:
    ```
    # Documentation
    mkdocs
    mkdocs-material
    ```

This ensures that anyone setting up the project will have the necessary tools to build and serve the documentation.

## Step 2: Create the Documentation Directory and Configuration

Next, we'll create the folder that will contain all our documentation source files and the main configuration file for MkDocs.

1.  **Create a docs directory** at the root of the devenviro.as repository. This will be the home for all our Markdown documentation files.

    ```
    devenviro.as/
    ├── app/
    ├── config/
    ├── docs/       <-- CREATE THIS DIRECTORY
    └── ...
    ```

2.  **Create the configuration file**. Inside the devenviro.as root directory, create a new file named `mkdocs.yml`.

3.  **Add the following initial configuration** to `mkdocs.yml`:

    ```yaml
    # mkdocs.yml
    site_name: DevEnviro Ecosystem Documentation
    site_url: [https://docs.devenviro.as/](https://docs.devenviro.as/)
    repo_url: [https://github.com/ApexSigma-Solutions/devenviro.as](https://github.com/ApexSigma-Solutions/devenviro.as) # Replace with your actual repo URL
    edit_uri: "" # Optional: link to edit pages in your repo

    theme:
      name: material
      palette:
        # Light mode
        - scheme: default
          toggle:
            icon: material/weather-sunny
            name: Switch to dark mode
        # Dark mode
        - scheme: slate
          toggle:
            icon: material/weather-night
            name: Switch to light mode
      features:
        - navigation.tabs
        - navigation.sections
        - search.suggest
        - search.highlight
        - content.code.copy

    nav:
      - 'Introduction': 'index.md'
      - 'Tutorials':
        - 'tutorials/index.md'
      - 'How-To Guides':
        - 'how-to/index.md'
      - 'Reference':
        - 'reference/index.md'
        - 'API Reference': 'reference/api.md'
      - 'Explanation':
        - 'explanation/index.md'
    ```

## Step 3: Create Initial Content

Let's create a homepage for our documentation site.

1.  Inside the `/docs` directory, create a new file named `index.md`.

2.  Add the following content to `docs/index.md`:

    ```markdown
    # Welcome to the DevEnviro Ecosystem Documentation

    This site serves as the central knowledge hub for the entire DevEnviro "Society of Agents" platform.

    Here you will find everything you need to understand, operate, and contribute to the project, including:

    - **Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides to get you started.
    - **How-To Guides:** Practical recipes for solving common problems.
    - **Reference:** Detailed technical information about the architecture, APIs, and code.
    - **Explanation:** High-level discussions on the project's philosophy and design decisions.
    ```

## Step 4: Run the Local Docs Server

You can now serve your documentation locally. It will live-reload whenever you make a change to a `.md` file or the `mkdocs.yml` config.

1.  **Open your terminal** in the `devenviro.as` root directory.
2.  **Run the following command:**
    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```
3.  **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You should see your new documentation site live!

## Step 5: Integrate into Docker (Optional, but Recommended)

To make the documentation a first-class citizen of our development environment, let's add it as a service to our Docker setup.

1.  **Open your docker-compose.yml file.**
2.  **Add the following service definition** to the `services` section:

    ```yaml
    # In docker-compose.yml

    services:
      # ... (postgres, rabbitmq, devenviro-api, etc.)

      docs:
        image: python:3.11-slim
        container_name: devenviro_docs
        working_dir: /app
        command: >
          sh -c "pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material &&
                 mkdocs serve --dev-addr 0.0.0.0:8000"
        volumes:
          - .:/app
        ports:
          - "8001:8000" # Expose on host port 8001 to avoid conflicts
        restart: unless-stopped
    ```

Now, when you run `docker-compose up`, the documentation site will be automatically served at `http://localhost:8001`.

## Next Steps

Our documentation system is now fully integrated! The next steps are to:

*   **Populate the content:** Start writing the tutorials, how-to guides, and explanations.
*   **Automate API Docs:** We can enhance the system to automatically pull the OpenAPI specs from our FastAPI services and render them in the "API Reference" section.
*   **Build the static site:** When you're ready to deploy, run `mkdocs build`. This will create a `site/` directory with all the static HTML files that you can host anywhere. Remember to add `/site` to your `.gitignore` file.
