# AI Agent Instructions: Node.js Monorepo README Drafter

## Objective
Your goal is to inspect a Node.js monorepo, identify its structure, and generate a comprehensive README.md file tailored to a React/TypeScript frontend and an Express.js backend.

**ARGUMENTS:** $ARGUMENTS

---
### Phase 1: Project Analysis

1.  **Identify Technology Stack:** Look for a root `package.json` and a workspace configuration file (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `lerna.json`, or `"workspaces"` in `package.json`).
2.  **Analyze Directory Structure:** Confirm the existence of `packages/frontend` and `packages/backend` directories.
3.  **Find Configuration:** Look for a `.env.example` file in the `packages/backend` directory.

---
### Phase 2: README Generation

1.  **Create README.md:** Create a new file named `README.md` in the project root. Ask for permission to overwrite if one already exists.
2.  **Draft Content:** Populate the file with the following structure, inferring details where possible.

    ```markdown
    # [Project Title]

    A full-stack application featuring a React (TypeScript) frontend and an Express.js backend.

    ## ✨ Features
    * (Placeholder: Describe the first key feature)
    * (Placeholder: Describe the second key feature)

    ## 🛠️ Technology Stack
    * **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
    * **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
    * **Package Manager:** (Placeholder: e.g., pnpm, npm, yarn)

    ## 📂 Project Structure
    This project is a monorepo with the following structure:
    ```
    .
    ├── /packages
    │   ├── /backend      # Express.js API
    │   └── /frontend     # React Client
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── package.json
    └── (pnpm-workspace.yaml | lerna.json)
    ```

    ## 🚀 Getting Started
    1.  **Clone:** `git clone <repository-url> && cd <repository-name>`
    2.  **Install:** `pnpm install` (or `npm install` / `yarn install`)
    3.  **Set up Environment:** `cd packages/backend && cp .env.example .env` (and update secrets).
    4.  **Run Dev Servers:** `pnpm run dev` (or `npm run dev` / `yarn dev`).
