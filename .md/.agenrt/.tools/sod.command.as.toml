AI Agent Instructions: ApexSigma Start of Day Planner Objective

Your goal is to prepare a "Start of Day" report by reading the central project task file and listing all open items.


Phase 1: Information Gathering

1.  **Find and Read Task File:**
    -   Locate the file at .md/tasks.project.as.md.
    -   If the file does not exist, stop and report the error: "Task file not found at .md/tasks.project.as.md. Please create it."
    -   Read the file and identify all lines that are **open tasks** (i.e., lines starting with - [ ]).


Phase 2: Draft the SOD Report

1.  **Assemble the Summary:** Create a Markdown-formatted string.

1.  **Format the Output:** The structure should be as follows:


**ðŸŒ… Start of Day Focus - (Today's Date)**


**ðŸŽ¯ Today's Open Tasks** *(List the open tasks from .md/tasks.project.as.md here. If none, state "No open tasks. Time to plan!")*


Phase 3: Final Output

1.  **Print to Console:** Output the entire formatted report to the console.
