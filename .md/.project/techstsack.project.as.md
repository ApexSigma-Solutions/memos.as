**memOS.as: Technology Stack**  
  
**Version:** 1.1  
  
The technology stack for memOS.as is designed to be consistent with the broader DevEnviro ecosystem, leveraging modern, high-performance, and Python-native tools.  
  
### 1. Core Framework

 *   **Python 3.11:** The primary programming language.
 *   **FastAPI:** The web framework used to build the RESTful API.

### 2. Database & Data Storage  
  
The memOS.as service will connect to the shared data infrastructure of the DevEnviro ecosystem.

 *   **PostgreSQL:** Used for storing the registered\_tools table.
 *   **Qdrant:** The vector database used for storing and searching episodic memories.
 *   **Redis:** Used for high-speed working memory and the LLM cache.

### 3. AI & Embeddings

 *   **LM Studio:** The desktop application used as the primary runner for all local LLMs and embedding models.
 *   **Generation Model:** The primary model for the Cortex Agent will be mistralai/devstral-small-2507, chosen for its strong native tool-use capabilities.
 *   **Embedding Model:** The primary model for the InGest-LLM pipeline will be lmstudio-community/nomic-embed-code-GGUF, chosen for its specialization in understanding code.
 *   **SDK:** The lmstudio-python SDK will be the primary interface for programmatic interaction with the models.

### 4. Environment & Deployment

 *   **Docker & Docker Compose:** The entire service will be containerized and defined as a service for easy integration into the main DevEnviro stack.
 *   **Pydantic Settings:** Environment variables and configuration will be managed through Pydantic's settings management.
