# Unified Task List: memOS.as

## Milestone 1: Foundational Setup & Core Service

### Phase 1: Project Initialization & Scaffolding (Day 1)

-   [x] **1.1: Create Project Directory & Git Repo**
    -   Create the memos.as directory.
    -   Run `git init` inside the new directory.
-   [x] **1.2: Scaffold the Service** (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)
    -   Run the ApexSigma command: `gemini -c scaffold service "memOS"`
    -   This creates the initial FastAPI app, Dockerfile, and `.md/project.md`.
    -   NOTE: Basic structure created, but missing main.py and Docker files-   [x] **1.3: Configure Docker Compose** (COMPLETED)
    -   Create a `docker-compose.yml` file.
    -   Add service definitions for `memos.as`, `redis`, `postgres`, and `qdrant`.
    -   Define a shared network for all services.
    -   NOTE: ✅ Verified - External services integration with devenviroas_default network
-   [x] **1.4: Define API Data Models**
    -   In `app/models.py`, create Pydantic models: `StoreRequest`, `QueryRequest`, `ToolRegistrationRequest`.
-   [x] **1.5: Create Database Table Migrations**
    -   Using SQLAlchemy or a migration tool, define the schema for the `registered_tools` table in PostgreSQL.
    -   NOTE: Comprehensive schema created with advanced features (FTS5, context versioning, etc.)

### Phase 2: Implement Tier 1 (Working Memory) & Tier 2 (Episodic Memory) (Day 2-4)

-   [ ] **2.1: Implement Redis Connection (Tier 1)** (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)
    -   Create `app/services/redis_client.py` to manage the connection.
    -   Add `redis-py` to `requirements.txt`.
    -   Implement `set_cache` and `get_cache` functions.
    -   NOTE: File created but empty, redis-py not in requirements.txt
-   [x] **2.2: Implement PostgreSQL Connection (Tier 2)** (COMPLETED)
    -   Create `app/services/postgres_client.py` using SQLAlchemy.
    -   Add `sqlalchemy` and `psycopg2-binary` to `requirements.txt`.
    -   Define the `memories` table schema.
    -   NOTE: ✅ Complete implementation with SQLAlchemy models, session management, and all schema tables
-   [x] **2.3: Implement Qdrant Connection (Tier 2)** (COMPLETED)
    -   Create `app/services/qdrant_client.py`.
    -   Add `qdrant-client` to `requirements.txt`.
    -   Implement logic to create the "memories" collection.
    -   NOTE: ✅ Complete implementation with vector storage, semantic search, and PostgreSQL integration

### Phase 3: Build Core API Endpoints (Day 5-6)

-   [x] **3.1: Implement Tool Management Endpoints** (COMPLETED)
    -   `POST /tools/register`: To register a new tool in the PostgreSQL `registered_tools` table.
    -   Create a seeding script to pre-populate initial tools.
    -   NOTE: ✅ Complete FastAPI app with tool endpoints and seeding script
-   [x] **3.2: Implement /memory/store Endpoint** (COMPLETED)
    -   **Logic**:
        1.  Generate an embedding for the content (use a placeholder function initially).
        2.  Store the full content/metadata in PostgreSQL to get a unique ID.
        3.  Store the vector embedding and the PostgreSQL ID in Qdrant.
        4.  Return the PostgreSQL ID.
    -   NOTE: ✅ Complete implementation with all 4 logic steps and error handling
-   [x] **3.3: Implement /memory/query Endpoint** (COMPLETED)
    -   **Logic**:
        1.  Generate an embedding for the query text.
        2.  Perform a semantic search in Qdrant to get relevant memory IDs.
        3.  Query PostgreSQL for tools that match the query context (Tool Discovery Logic).
        4.  Retrieve full memory entries from PostgreSQL.
        5.  Return a combined response of relevant memories and tools.
    -   NOTE: ✅ Complete implementation with all 5 logic steps, similarity scoring, and tool discovery
-   [x] **3.4: Write Initial Integration Tests** (COMPLETED)
    -   Create a `tests/` directory.
    -   Write tests that call `/tools/register`, `/memory/store`, and then `/memory/query` to verify the end-to-end flow.
    -   NOTE: ✅ Tests written and successfully executed - all core endpoints working

## Milestone 2: Ingestion & Ecosystem Integration

### Phase 4: Build InGest-LLM Pipeline Components

-   [ ] **4.1: Develop Python AST Parser** (STARTED)
    -   Create a utility to extract docstrings and function definitions from Python files.
    -   NOTE: InGestLLM directory exists with configuration
-   [ ] **4.2: Develop Generic Scrapers** (NOT STARTED)
    -   Build modular scrapers for fetching content from web pages and code repositories.
-   [ ] **4.3: Develop Content-to-JSON Parser** (STARTED)
    -   Create a component to transform raw scraped data into a standardized JSON format.
    -   NOTE: Configuration exists showing JSON knowledge graph structure
-   [ ] **4.4: Create InGest-LLM Orchestration Service** (NOT STARTED)
    -   Build the main service that orchestrates the scraping, parsing, and storing of knowledge by calling the `memOS.as` `/memory/store` endpoint.

### Phase 5: Agent Loadouts & Final Integration

-   [ ] **5.1: Develop "Agent Loadout" Specification** (NOT STARTED)
    -   Define the YAML structure for scripts that specify an agent's persona, knowledge sources, and tool library.
-   [ ] **5.2: Integrate with devenviro.as** (NOT STARTED)
    -   Add the `memos.as` service to the main `devenviro.as` docker-compose file.
    -   Ensure the orchestrator can call `memOS.as` to enrich tasks with context.
-   [x] **5.3: Create Documentation** (COMPLETED)
    -   Create the initial set of Markdown files for the `memOS.as` documentation within its own `.md/` directory.
    -   NOTE: CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, README.md, and project documentation created
