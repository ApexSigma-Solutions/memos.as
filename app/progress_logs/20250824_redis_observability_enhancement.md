# File: src/embedding_agent/observability/metrics.py
class MetricsMiddleware:
    """Comprehensive performance monitoring middleware"""

    # ‚úÖ Metrics Collection:
    - HTTP request timing and endpoint analytics
    - Error rates and status code distribution
    - Slow request detection and alerting
    - Cache performance indicators
