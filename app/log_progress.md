### Summary of Previous Progress
- Verified outstanding tasks and ensured environment alignment (Docker, Poetry, Ruff).
- Completed planning and implementation of a FastAPI-based A2A bridge with RabbitMQ and agent registry integration.
- Implemented message polling mechanism and integrated the bridge into Docker Compose for unified orchestration.
- Reviewed production readiness, suggested improvements, and consolidated all projects.
- Saved a persistent summary of the chat session and technical progress to `copilot.persist.as.md`.

### Previous Next Steps
- Address YAML lint errors in Docker Compose for deployment stability.
- Implement persistent message storage and authentication for production.
- Proceed with Sigma Coder integration and CI/CD implementation for the consolidated ecosystem.
