# Overview
The project involves implementing an MCP HTTP client that can interact with the memOS.as server. The client will be used to authenticate with the server and perform basic memory operations such as storing and recalling memories. This will enable agent communication with the live memOS.as server.

The problem this solves is the need for a functional, tested, and reusable HTTP client that can communicate with the memOS MCP server. This will allow AI agents to store and retrieve memories from the server, which is a core functionality of the memOS system.

# Core Features
## HTTP Client Implementation
- Implementation of an asynchronous HTTP client using httpx library
- JWT authentication flow for secure server communication
- Memory storage and retrieval capabilities
- Error handling and proper response processing

## Authentication
- JWT token generation and management
- Secure authentication with the memOS server
- Proper header management for authenticated requests

## Memory Operations
- Store memory functionality using the MCP store_memory_tool endpoint
- Recall memory functionality using the MCP query_memory_by_mcp_tier_tool endpoint
- Proper data formatting for memory operations

# User Experience
The primary users of this HTTP client are AI agents that need to interact with the memOS system. The client should provide a simple, reliable interface for these agents to store and retrieve memories. The implementation should be robust and handle various error conditions gracefully.

# Technical Architecture
## System Components
- Async HTTP client using httpx library
- Authentication module for JWT handling
- Memory operations module for storing and recalling memories
- Test scaffolding for validation

## Data Models
- JWT token structure
- Memory data structure for storage and retrieval
- Response models for API interactions

## APIs and Integrations
- memOS MCP server endpoints:
  - Authentication endpoint
  - store_memory_tool endpoint
  - query_memory_by_mcp_tier_tool endpoint

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Python 3.13 environment
- httpx library for HTTP requests
- asyncio for asynchronous operations
- Access to memOS MCP server

# Development Roadmap
## Phase 1: Environment & Test Scaffolding
- Confirm httpx is present in requirements.txt
- Create test_mcp_http_client.py file
- Set up basic project structure for testing

## Phase 2: Client Logic & End-to-End Testing
- Implement async main function with necessary imports
- Implement JWT authentication flow
- Implement memory storage functionality
- Implement memory recall functionality
- Conduct end-to-end testing of all features

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Environment setup (httpx installation, file creation)
2. Basic async client structure
3. Authentication implementation
4. Memory storage implementation
5. Memory recall implementation
6. Integration testing of all components

# Risks and Mitigations
## Technical Challenges
- Authentication issues with JWT tokens: Implement proper error handling and logging
- Memory storage/retrieval failures: Implement comprehensive error handling and validation
- Network connectivity issues: Implement retry mechanisms and proper timeout handling

## MVP Approach
- Start with basic HTTP client functionality
- Implement authentication as the first major feature
- Add memory operations incrementally
- Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next

## Resource Constraints
- Limited access to live memOS server for testing: Implement comprehensive mock testing where possible
- Time constraints: Focus on core functionality first, with enhancements added later
