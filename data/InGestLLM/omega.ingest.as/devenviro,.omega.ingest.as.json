        "memOS.as Feature-Complete: The `memos.as` microservice is now feature-complete and production-ready, with all major architectural components implemented and tested.",
        "Full-Stack Architecture Implemented: The complete multi-tier memory system (Tier 1: Redis, Tier 2: PostgreSQL/Qdrant, Tier 3: Neo4j) and the comprehensive observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger) have been successfully integrated.",
        "Architectural Split Formalized: The architectural decision to separate data ingestion (`InGest-LLM.as`) from memory management (`memOS.as`) was confirmed, and new, detailed project plans were generated for both microservices.",
        "Documentation & Config Standards Established: Defined a three-layered documentation strategy (Source of Truth -> Agent Ingestion -> Public Docs) and standardized naming conventions for all TOML and Markdown files.",
        "Project Management Framework Established: Configured Linear as the project management tool with standardized teams, labels, and issue templates.",
        "Agent Rules & Personas Formalized: Established a central `memory.rules.md` file to govern agent interactions and refined agent personas for the new architecture.",
        "Critical Implementation Issues Resolved: Overcame numerous blockers during development, including architectural misunderstandings, circular dependencies, and configuration/credential issues.",
        "Secure Workflow Established: Centralized and secured all project environment variables using Dotenv Vault and successfully committed the final feature branch.",
        "Brand Identity Solidified: Established the core visual identity for 'ApexSigma Solutions' and produced a foundational 'Dark Mode Service Card' as a template."
